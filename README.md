# WargamingAPI
It's unoffical library of WargamingAPI on .NET Core. With it, you shouldn't write URL - request for getting data. You only have to call methods from it. 

## Supproted platforms
.NET 5 (Windows, Linux and MacOS).

## How to launch unit test

You have to create file `data.xml`. Then, you need to put this:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<wot>
    <apiKey>INSERT YOUR APP KEY GENEREATED BY WARGAMING</apiKey>
</wot>
```
Then, it should works.

## Documentation

Work in progress.
